# GGH_crypto Python Package
This repository contains a Python package implementing the Goldreich-Goldwasser-Halevi (GGH) public key cryptosystem and its optimization, GGH-HNF by Micciancio. The GGH cryptosystem is a lattice-based cryptographic system proposed in 1997, which offers potential resistance against quantum computer attacks.

# Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a 3-year degree program at the Universit√† degli Studi di Milano (University of Milan). It aims to provide a practical implementation of the GGH cryptosystem and its GGH-HNF variant, allowing users to experiment with lattice-based cryptography.
