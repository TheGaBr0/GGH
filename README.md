# Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a 3-year degree program at the Universit√† degli Studi di Milano (University of Milan). It aims to provide a comprehensive implementation and analysis of the GGH lattice-based cryptosystem and its GGH-HNF variant using modern tools. The work explores the resilience of lattice-based cryptography against quantum threats, offering in-depth mathematical analysis, cryptanalysis, and experimental results on performance and security. A novel hybrid variant is introduced, combining elements of both systems. By comparing findings with classical cryptosystems and previous studies, the project assesses the practical viability of these lattice-based schemes in current technological contexts.
# GGH_crypto Python Package
This repository contains a Python package implementing the Goldreich-Goldwasser-Halevi (GGH) public key cryptosystem and its optimization, GGH-HNF by Micciancio. The GGH cryptosystem is a lattice-based cryptographic system proposed in 1997, which offers potential resistance against quantum computer attacks. Unfortunately, despite their theoretical interest, both the original GGH cryptosystem and its GGH-HNF optimization have been declared as practically unusable due to security vulnerabilities and performance limitations. This implementation serves primarily for educational and research purposes, offering insights into the challenges and developments in lattice-based cryptography.
The package uses and implements essential functions for lattice-based cryptography, such as:
- Algorithms for solving the Closest Vector Problem (CVP):
    - Babai's rounding technique
    - Embedding technique
- Lattice reduction algorithms:
    - Wrapped FPLLL implementation of BKZ
    - Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
    - FLINT implementation of LLL

The package is composed by 3 specific subpackages:
- `GGH.py` which implements the original cryptosystem presented in 1997.
- `GGH_HNF.py` which implements the optimised version of GGH proposed by Micciancio in 2002.
- `Utils.py` which includes functions and methods in common between the 2 cryptosystems. It also contains general algorithms -or wrappers for them- related to the lattice-based cryptography, such as: BKZ, Gram-Schmidt, and CVP solvers.  

# Installation
The Package can be simply installed with PIP: 
```
pip install GGH-crypto
```
However, to use the BKZ reduction, it's necessary to install the external FPLLL library. FPLLL is only compatible with Linux. You can refer to [this link](https://github.com/fplll/fplll#compilation) for installation steps on various operative systems.
