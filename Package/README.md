# GGH-crypto
GGH-crypto is a Python package implementing the Goldreich-Goldwasser-Halevi (GGH) public key cryptosystem and its optimization, GGH-HNF by Micciancio. This package is designed for educational and research purposes, offering insights into lattice-based cryptography.
This project was developed as part of a 3-year degree program at the Universit√† degli Studi di Milano (University of Milan). It explores the resilience of lattice-based cryptography against quantum threats and introduces an hybrid variant.

# Features

- Implementation of the original GGH cryptosystem (1997)
- Implementation of the GGH-HNF optimization (2002)
- Utility functions for lattice-based cryptography
- Algorithms for solving the Closest Vector Problem (CVP)
- Lattice reduction algorithms

# Usage and details

# Note
Both the original GGH cryptosystem and its GGH-HNF optimization have known security vulnerabilities. This implementation is not intended for production use.
